# ChatGPT experiment - generating algorithms in Kotlin

This repo contains solutions generated by ChatGPT (currently at v3.5)
for various problems as stated in the tables below.

I request that ChatGPT create unit tests for each algorithm and then move
these unit tests into the test/kotlin hierarchy.

The repo uses the gradle system to build (*.kts) and is run in
the awesome IntelliJ IDEA integrated developement environment (IDE). 
Currentl version installed is v2021.3.3.
