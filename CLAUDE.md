# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Archive of algorithm solutions (LeetCode, CodeWars, HackerRank) generated by ChatGPT 3.5 and Google Bard in 2023. This is a historical/educational repository, not actively developed.

## Build & Test Commands

```bash
# Build
./gradlew build

# Run all tests
./gradlew test

# Run a single test class
./gradlew test --tests "leetcode.P0007ReverseIntegerTest"
```

## Tech Stack

- **Kotlin** 2.0.21 on JVM toolchain Java 17+
- **Gradle** 9.3.0 (Kotlin DSL)
- **JUnit 5** (Jupiter 5.9.2)

## Code Structure

Source and test code is organized by platform under `src/main/kotlin/` and `src/test/kotlin/`:

- `leetcode/` — LeetCode problems (P0007, P0042, P0085)
- `codeWars/` — CodeWars problems (TwoOldestAges, EncryptThis)
- `hackerRank/` — HackerRank problems (BuyingShowTickets)
- `bardGoogle/` — Google Bard experiments (SevenBridgesOfKonigsberg, MaxPointsOnALine)

Each source file has a corresponding `*Test` class in the matching test package.

## Known Issues

- **Gradle 9.x requires `junit-platform-launcher`**: The `testRuntimeOnly("org.junit.platform:junit-platform-launcher")` dependency is required in `build.gradle.kts`. Without it, tests fail with "Failed to load JUnit Platform."
- **3 of 4 SevenBridgesOfKonigsberg tests fail**: The Bard-generated algorithm is broken (DFS never returns `true`). These failures are intentionally preserved as historical record.
